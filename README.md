## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Logical properties

### What I learned

I've learned that we can center an element with the help of grid layout
with this snippet


```css
.centered-container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

The solution does not work for vertical writing mode so I will have to figure out how i can fix it.

### Useful resources

- MDN CSS reference [css reference](https://www.example.com) - This helped me to understand the specifications.
